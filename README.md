# Usage
This core is aimed for mods that can be used without Steamodded.

To start, change `YourModName` to desired mod name in all files. Then do the same for `your-mod-name` (preferably in kebab notation). Make sure to do so for `your-mod-name.lua` as well, as this will be your "anchor" file to find this mod folder.
